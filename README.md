# ath10k-fix-QCA9377
Fixed ath10k drivers for the Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 card. After the latest update the drivers for the Qualcomm 9377 card would not load. This files should be able to solve that.

# Usage
Substitute the folder QCA9377 in /lib/firmware/ath10k/ for the one in the repository, this should work. :)
